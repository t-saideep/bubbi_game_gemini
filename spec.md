# Balloon catch

## Idea

Balloon catch is a game for infants who are learning motor skills. The game should work on iOS with a focus on both iPhone and iPad. The game should have a simple interface with a balloon that moves around the screen. The balloon should move around the screen in a random direction. It should bounce off the edges of the screen. The user should be able to tap on the balloon to pop it. The balloon should pop and disappear when the user taps on it with a popping animation. There should be no other UI elements on the screen.

## Features

- [ ] The balloon should move around the screen in a random direction.
- [ ] The balloon should bounce off the edges of the screen.
- [ ] The user should be able to tap on the balloon to pop it.

## Tech stack

- [ ] Swift
- [ ] SwiftUI

## Design

- [ ] The balloon should be a red circle with a dangling string.
- [ ] The balloon should move around the screen in a random direction.
- [ ] The balloon should bounce off the edges of the screen.
- [ ] The balloon should pop and disappear when the user taps on it with a popping animation.
- [ ] There should be no other UI elements on the screen.

## Implementation

- [ ] We need the constants defined separately so we can easily change them. This includes the balloon size, the string length, the screen size, the balloon speed, the popping animation duration, etc.

## Testing

- [ ] We should be able to do automated testing of the game on the simulator
- [ ] We should run the tests every time we make a change to the code
